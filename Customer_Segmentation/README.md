### Overview

In this project, we work with real-life data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.I have used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then used those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, data has been assessed and cleaned in order to convert it into a usable form.
